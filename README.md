# ClinkClank

division function of  a calculator resulting in clinkclank, clink or clank depending on if it's divisible by 6, 8 or both 

# How it works?

Just like any other calculator, except it's only division...just enter a number and it'll tell you if it's divisable by  6 & 8 which results in 'clinkclank', if it's divisable by just 6 which results in 'clink', or if it's divisable by just 8 which reults in 'clank'. If your number isn't divisable by either then it will just return your number along with the test results of the code.
